## Features of Mojo

1. **Speed**: Mojo boasts a speed about 35000 times faster than Python. This provides a significant advantage in high-performance programming.

2. **Python3 Support**: It supports all the syntax of Python3, making it easily accessible for developers familiar with Python.

3. **Supports Various Programming Paradigms**: It supports a wide range of programming paradigms including functional programming, procedural programming, and data science.

4. **Type System**: Python is a dynamically typed language; the data type of variables is not explicitly declared. On the other hand, Mojo is statically typed; you must explicitly declare the data type of variables.

5. **Usage**: Both Python and Mojo are powerful programming languages each with their own strengths and weaknesses. Generally speaking, while Python is suitable for general-purpose programming, Mojo is well-suited for machine learning and artificial intelligence applications.

## Conclusion
With many differentiated features compared to Python, Mojo can be a powerful tool that can deliver high performance in specific fields.
